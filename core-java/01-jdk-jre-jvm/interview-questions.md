# 🎯 Interview Questions: JDK vs JRE vs JVM

This document covers **core interview questions**, **common traps**, and **safe explanations** related to **JDK**, **JRE**, and **JVM**.  
Designed for quick revision and confident interview answers.

---

## 1. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

### ✅ Clear Answer
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
  Used to *develop* Java applications. Includes the compiler (`javac`) and development tools.

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**  
  Provides the *runtime environment* required to run Java applications.

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**  
  Executes Java **bytecode** and handles memory management, garbage collection, and threading.

---

## 2. Can we run Java code without the JDK?

### ✅ Correct Answer
Yes. Java applications can be run using **only the JRE**.

### ⚠️ Interview Trap
Many candidates incorrectly claim that the JDK is required to run Java programs.

---

## 3. Does the JVM compile Java code?

### ❌ No.
- Java source code is compiled by **`javac`**, which is part of the **JDK**.
- The **JVM does not compile source code**—it executes bytecode.

---

## 4. Is Java completely platform independent?

### ✅ Interview-Safe Answer
Java source code is platform independent, but the bytecode runs on **platform-specific JVM implementations**.

---

## 5. Why is the JVM platform dependent?

### Explanation
The JVM interacts directly with:
- the operating system
- the underlying hardware

Because different platforms work differently, each platform requires its **own JVM implementation**.

---

## 6. What is bytecode?

### Answer
Bytecode is an **intermediate representation** of Java source code generated by the compiler and executed by the JVM.

---

## 7. Why don’t production servers install the JDK?

### Reason
- Production servers only need to **run** Java applications.
- The **JRE is sufficient**.
- Installing the JDK increases the **attack surface** and is unnecessary in production.

---

## 8. What happens if the JVM is not present on a system?

### Answer
Java bytecode **cannot be executed**.  
The JVM is mandatory for running any Java application.

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Saying Java runs directly on the operating system
- ❌ Saying the JVM compiles Java code
- ❌ Saying the JDK is required to run Java programs
- ❌ Claiming Java is 100% platform independent

---

## 🧠 One Interview-Safe Statement

> “The JDK is used for development, the JRE is used for running Java applications, and the JVM is responsible for executing bytecode and managing runtime behavior.”

---

## 📌 Quick Mental Model

.java → javac → .class (bytecode) → JVM → OS / Hardware
