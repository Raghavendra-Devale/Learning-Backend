## Common Interview Traps

❌ Saying overloading is runtime polymorphism  
❌ Ignoring reference vs object type difference  
❌ Saying static methods are overridden  
❌ Forgetting that private methods are not polymorphic  
❌ Overusing instanceof

## One Interview-Safe Explanation

> Polymorphism enables a common interface to represent multiple implementations, with runtime method resolution based on the actual object type, supporting flexible and extensible backend design.
