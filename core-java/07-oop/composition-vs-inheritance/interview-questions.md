---

## LEVEL 0 – Academic

1. What is inheritance?
2. What is composition?
3. Difference between IS-A and HAS-A?

---

## LEVEL 1 – Fresher

1. When should inheritance be used?
2. When should composition be used?
3. Why is composition considered flexible?
4. What is delegation?

---

## LEVEL 2 – 1–2 YOE

1. What is fragile base class problem?
2. Why is inheritance tightly coupled?
3. How does composition improve testability?
4. How does composition support dependency injection?
5. Why is deep inheritance dangerous?

---

## LEVEL 3 – 2–3 YOE

1. Why do modern frameworks prefer composition?
2. How does composition support Open-Closed Principle?
3. Give real backend example of replacing inheritance with composition.
4. How does inheritance break encapsulation?
5. How can inheritance cause concurrency issues?
6. When is inheritance the correct design choice?

---

## Senior / Twisted Questions

1. Is inheritance required for polymorphism?
2. Can composition replace inheritance completely?
3. How does composition impact memory usage?
4. Why did Go avoid inheritance?
5. Can inheritance increase system rigidity?
6. What happens if parent class is not designed for extension?

## Common Interview Traps

❌ Using inheritance only for reuse  
❌ Confusing delegation with inheritance  
❌ Ignoring tight coupling  
❌ Not knowing fragile base class problem  
❌ Saying composition is always better

## One Interview-Safe Explanation

> Composition is generally preferred over inheritance because it reduces tight coupling, improves flexibility, and allows behavior to be changed dynamically, which aligns better with modern backend architecture.
