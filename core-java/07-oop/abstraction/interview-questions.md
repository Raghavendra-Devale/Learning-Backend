2. Can abstract class have constructor?
3. Can interface have method implementation?
4. Can interface have variables?
5. Can abstract class implement interface?

---

## LEVEL 2 – 1–2 YOE

1. Difference between interface and abstract class?
2. When should you use interface over abstract class?
3. Why does Java allow multiple interface inheritance but not class inheritance?
4. What are default methods?
5. What problem did default methods solve?
6. Can interface have private methods?

---

## LEVEL 3 – 2–3 YOE

1. How does abstraction enable dependency injection?
2. Why are interfaces preferred in Spring?
3. What are the risks of deep abstract class hierarchies?
4. How does abstraction support Open-Closed Principle?
5. Should every class have an interface?
6. How do default methods affect API evolution?

## Senior / Twisted Questions

1. Can you achieve abstraction without interfaces?
2. Is abstract class more powerful than interface?
3. Why did Java introduce default methods in Java 8?
4. Can abstraction increase complexity?
5. What happens if two interfaces have same default method?
6. How does JVM handle interface method dispatch?
7. Can an interface extend another interface?

## Common Interview Traps

❌ Saying abstraction = data hiding  
❌ Confusing interface with abstract class  
❌ Saying interface cannot have implementation (post Java 8)  
❌ Creating interfaces without purpose  
❌ Ignoring multiple inheritance advantage

## One Interview-Safe Explanation

> Abstraction defines a contract by exposing only essential behavior while hiding implementation details, typically achieved using interfaces or abstract classes, enabling flexible and loosely coupled backend systems.
