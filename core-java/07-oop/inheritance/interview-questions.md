4. What is diamond problem?
5. Can constructors be inherited?

---

## LEVEL 2 – 1–2 YOE

2. Why is inheritance considered tight coupling?
3. What happens if parent method changes?
4. What are method overriding rules?
5. Can private methods be overridden?
6. What is covariant return type?
7. Why should inheritance not be used just for reuse?

---

## LEVEL 3 – 2–3 YOE

1. When should you prefer composition over inheritance?
2. How does inheritance break encapsulation?
3. How can inheritance cause concurrency issues?
4. What is Liskov Substitution Principle?

2. Is inheritance required for code reuse?
3. What happens if overridden method throws broader exception?
4. Why are deep inheritance hierarchies dangerous?
5. Can inheritance increase memory footprint?

## Common Interview Traps

❌ Using inheritance for code reuse only  
❌ Confusing HAS-A with IS-A  
❌ Ignoring overriding rules  
❌ Forgetting constructor order  
❌ Not knowing diamond problem  
❌ Saying Java supports multiple inheritance of classes

## One Interview-Safe Explanation

> Inheritance establishes an IS-A relationship and enables runtime polymorphism, but it introduces tight coupling. Modern backend systems prefer composition to reduce fragility and improve flexibility.
