## Common Interview Traps

❌ Saying OOP models the real world (too shallow)
❌ Defining pillars without explaining purpose
❌ Ignoring design trade-offs
❌ Confusing abstraction with encapsulation
❌ Over-glorifying inheritance

## One Interview-Safe Explanation

> OOP organizes systems by binding state and behavior into objects, improving modularity, maintainability, and scalability, while reducing uncontrolled state mutation.
